address for access. *Created via database admin for now


### `Redux Form` post Newsletters

Logging in checks credentials and reloads the dashboard to present<br />
options for creating posts to the database.

### `Landing Page`

Landing page requires no login to access. Non-admin end users may see posts made<br />
by admin interface.

Once logged into Admin Interface, there is the option to review posts <br />
and edit posts of any user.
